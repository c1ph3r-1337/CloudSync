**CloudSync** is a cloud-based network storage solution (basically a NAS) for the ESP32, made by **c1ph3r-1337**. It uses an SD card for file storage and serves a responsive web UI to upload, download, and delete files in real time.

## Features üöÄ
- **WiFi Connection**: Connects to your network using a static IP.
- **SD Card Storage**: Uses an 8‚ÄØGB SD card (formatted as FAT32) to store files.
- **Responsive Web UI**: Manage files with a modern, mobile-friendly interface.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Uses WebSockets (port 81) to update the UI on file changes.
- **Folder Management**: Create and delete folders to organize your files.
- **Dynamic Storage Indicator**: Sums file sizes to show used, free, and total storage.

## Hardware Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
- **ESP32 Doit DevKit V1**  
- **SD Card Module** (CS connected to pin 5 by default)  
- **8‚ÄØGB SD Card** (formatted as FAT32)

## Software Requirements üñ•Ô∏è
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) or [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)  
- ESP32 board package (platform = `espressif32`)

## Environment Configuration üìã
Below is an example `platformio.ini` for PlatformIO:

```ini
[env:esp32doit-devkit-v1]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32doit-devkit-v1
framework = arduino
```

## Wiring Diagram üîå
Connect the SD card module to the ESP32 as follows:
- **CS**: Pin 5 (or update in code if needed)
- **MOSI**, **MISO**, **SCK**: Connect to the corresponding SPI pins on the ESP32
- **Power & GND**: Connect to 3.3V and GND respectively

## How It Works ü§î
1. **WiFi & SD Initialization**:  
   The ESP32 connects to your WiFi network using a static IP and initializes the SD card.

2. **HTTP Server & WebSockets**:  
   - An HTTP server runs on port **80** to serve the UI and handle file operations.  
   - A WebSocket server on port **81** sends real-time notifications when files or folders are added or deleted.

3. **File and Folder Operations**:  
   - **Upload**: Files can be uploaded (and optionally placed in folders) and stored on the SD card.  
   - **Download**: Files can be downloaded directly from the UI.  
   - **Delete**: Files (or folders via the `/rmdir` endpoint) can be deleted.  
   - **List**: The `/list` endpoint returns a JSON array of files and folders (with optional filtering).  
   - **Storage Info**: The `/storage` endpoint recursively sums file sizes to display total, used, and free storage.

4. **Responsive UI**:  
   The web interface features a sidebar with a dynamic storage indicator and folder list, plus a main area for file management. The layout adjusts automatically for mobile devices.

## How to Flash üì°
1. Connect your ESP32 to your computer.  
2. Wire the SD card module according to the wiring diagram.  
3. Use PlatformIO or the Arduino IDE to compile and flash the code.  
4. Once flashed, open a browser and navigate to [http://192.168.1.100/](http://192.168.1.100/) to access CloudSync.
